1. 君がみ胸に, 抱かれて聞くは
kimi ga mi mune ni, dakarete kiku wa
Cradled to your chest, I can hear

夢の船歌, 鳥の歌
yume no funa uta, tori no uta
the song of the ship from my dreams, the song of the birds

水の蘇州の, 花散る春を
mizu no Soshuu no, hanachiru haru o
Will you long for spring with its scattered blossoms

惜しむか, 柳がすすり泣く
oshimu ka, yanagi ga susuri naku
in watery Suzhou? The willow weeps

====
2. 花を浮かべて, 流れる水の
hana o ukabete, nagareru mizu no
floating flowers, flowing water

明日の行方は, 知らねども
asu no yukue wa, shirane domo
Where will tomorrow be? I don't know though

こよい映した, ふたりのすがた
koyoi utsushita, futari no sugata
It was so cool, The shape of the two

消えてくれるな, いつまでも
kiete kureru na, itsu made mo
It will disappear, forever

===
3. 髪に飾ろうか,くちづけしようか
kami ni kazarou ka, kuchizuke shiyou ka
Shall I put it in my hair? Shall I press it to my lips?

君が手折りし, 桃の花
kimi ga taorishi, momo no hana
The peach blossom you broke off to give to me

涙ぐむような,おぼろの月に
namida gumu you na, oboro no tsuki ni
In the moonlight, hazy as though with tears

鐘が鳴ります, 寒山寺
kane ga narimasu, kan zan ji
the bell rings at Kanzanji

Translation:

Don't disappear, forever

In the moonlight, hazy as though with tears
the bell rings at Kanzanji
