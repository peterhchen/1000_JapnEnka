柔 (Flexibility)
勝つと思うな　思えば負けよ
負けて元々　この胸の
奥に生きてる柔の夢が
一生、一度、一生、一度を　待っている

I'll never take victory for granted. If I do, I'll lose. 
I'll have lost before I start: 
My deep-seated flexibility has been waiting, 
All my life, for its moment!

 
人は人なり　のぞみもあるが
捨てて立つ瀬を超えもする
せめて今宵は人間らしく
恋の涙を　恋の涙を　噛みしめる

I'm only human and I have things I want,
But sometimes, only by giving up my position can I achieve my goals. 
At least for tonight, I will give in to my humanity 
And taste the tears of love!

 
口で言うより手の方が早い
馬鹿を相手の時じゃない
行くも住るも座るもふすも
柔一すじ柔一すじ夜が明ける

My hand moves faster than the tongue can speak; 
My stupefied rival won't have time to respond. 
Whether I'm attacking, pausing, holding back, or submitting, 
A little bit of flexibility will make the darkest night into
